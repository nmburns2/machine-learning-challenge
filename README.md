# Machine_Learning_Challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to demonstrate a knowledge of working with machine learning by aiming to build models that could classify exoplanets from a dataset.

I worked with two different models: Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Data Exploration:
	Read the data from the expoplanet CSV into a DataFrame
	Cleaned the data by dropping columns and rows with null values

Preprocessing Dataset:
	Scaled the data using MinMaxScaler
	Seperated data into training and testing data

Tune Model Parameters:
	Tuned model parameters using GridSearch

Evaluate and Compare Models
	Used the accuracy of the two models craeted to choose the best model
 
Conclusion:

The testing accuracy accuracy for the Logistic Regression model was 0.8804 and the SVM model was 0.8758. Both models took around 22 seconds to train the model.

Given the similarity in time to train the model, the slighty higher accuracy score of the Logistic Regression model makes it the better choice.
